Script to post earthquake alerts to twitter

This is the script used by the [nz_quake](https://twitter.com/nz_quake) twitter bot to check for earthquaker on [Geonet's API](https://www.geonet.org.nz/) and then post to twitter.

# To get working

This really won't work as is. You'll need to.

* Attach it to your twitter account
* Make sure the Oysttyer binary and keyfile's are in your local directory
* Test manually via command line post
* Run this script periodicly
